- Always use absolute paths for all commands you run on the command line
  because our code is often in subdirectories
- Do NOT use absolute paths for any commands in the code, always use from $PATH
  because binaries may be at different paths on different systems
- Our code must be cross-platform and work on BSDs and Linux
- Don't do shortcuts, use proper GNUstep architecture patterns
- Write GNUstep compatible code. Don't use features unavailable in GNUstep such as CoreFoundation.
- Always use GNUstep architecture and conventions and design patterns.
- All code must compile and run correctly on both macOS and GNUstep on Linux.
- Never hardcode paths to binaries, always use commands from the `$PATH`.
- Our GNUstep environment is installed in /System and you also have access to its source.
- NEVER try to install GNUstep with the package manager or use it from /usr
- The GCD dispatch functions are available and should be used.
- ARC should be used.
- Use commands from `$PATH`, not hardcoded paths.
- Use `gmake`, not `make`.
- We may be running on Linux or on FreeBSD. Write all code to be portable.
- Avoid bashisms; use POSIX sh.
- Build the application until it works, even with multiple attempts.
- Use -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O2, fix all compiler warnings, regardless of severity.
- Compile with `clang`, never `gcc`.
- Use extensive logging for debugging with NSLog.
- If you build a preference pane, test with `SystemPreferences` on the `$PATH`.
- Before running any shell commands, check which shell is being used.
- We may not have `strace`, in that case use `truss` for tracing system calls.
- Use Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture where appropriate.
- Use KVO (Key-Value Observing) for observing changes in properties where needed.
- Always use a `GNUmakefile` to compile anything involving Foundation or GNUstep.
- Never "create a simple test to verify" anything. Verify using /System/Applications/LoginWindow.app or other system applications.
- For all UI elements, follow the instuctions from AppearanceMetrics.h
- Buttons are 24 px high and neighboring ones are 12 px apart from each other.
- Use `NSLocalizedString` for all user-facing strings to ensure they are localizable.
- Unless specifically asked to do so never write test cases; instead, use the existing real applications to verify functionality.
- NEVER write any summary files, unless specifically requested to do so. Never summarize successes.
- To test GNUstep applications, use the MCP tools provided by uibridge,
  use uibridge to launch the target .app bundle using an absolute path
  and then use uibridge to exercise it
- Prefer using the uibridge tools to running commands in Terminal
- DO NOT EVER put strings with /home/... into any source code
- ALWAYS `killall UIBridgeServer` after having edited/compiled it
- Whenever you encounter compiler warnings, fix them. Builds must succed with no warnings.
